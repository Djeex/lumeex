**Lumeex** - Yet another minimalist photo gallery with a static site generator.

Lumeex is a static site generator that builds a minimalist photo gallery. The project was born from the need to create a gallery focused more on the artworks than the author, while allowing users to organize works using tags and share filtered views. In this spirit, each page load displays the photos in random order, allowing users to discover new content they might not have seen before.

The project comes with two themes: one modern, the other more minimalistic, both designed to keep the focus on the artworks:
  - Modern ðŸ‘‰ [demo](https://modern.djeex.fr)
  - Typewriter ðŸ‘‰ [demo](https://typewriter.djeex.fr)

> [!NOTE]
> _This GitHub repository is a mirror of https://git.djeex.fr/Djeex/lumeex. Youâ€™ll find the complete package, history, and release notes there. An LLM is used for bug checking._

## Configuration

All user configuration files are located in the `config` folder.

```sh
Lumeex/
â””â”€â”€ config/
    â”œâ”€â”€ photos/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ gallery
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ hero
    â”œâ”€â”€ themes/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ modern
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ typewriter
    â”œâ”€â”€ gallery.yaml
    â””â”€â”€ site.yaml
```

**`photos/`**

- `gallery/`: place your gallery photos here.  
- `hero/`: place carousel photos for the homepage here.

> [!TIP]
> You can use `gallery.py` to automatically reference all photos in `gallery/` and `hero/` into `gallery.yaml` and `site.yaml` by running `python3 gallery.py` from the `lumeex` directory.  
> Youâ€™ll just need to tag the photos in `gallery.yaml`.

**`site.yaml`**

This file contains all your siteâ€™s metadata and settings. For example:

```yaml
info:
  title: your title
  subtitle: your subtitle
  description: your description
  canonical: all, your, keywords
  author: you
  google_analytics_id: G-XXXXXXX # optional

social:
  instagram_url: https://www.instagram.com/yourprofile
  thumbnail: gallery/anyphoto.png # put the path from your photo folder to your file
menu:
  items:
  - label: your_home
    href: /
  - label: your_second_menu
    href: /?tag=yourtag1
  - label: Your_third_menu
    href: /?tag=yourtag2

hero:
  images:
  - src: hero/your_photo_1.jpg
  - src: hero/your_photo_2.jpg
  - src: hero/your_photo_3.jpg

footer:
  copyright: Copyright Â© 2025 â€“ You
  legal_link: '/legals.html'
  legal_label: Legal notice

build:
  theme: modern
  convert_images: false
  resize_images: false

legals:

  hoster_contact: Your hoster contact
  intellectual_property:
    - paragraph: "Your text here"
    - paragraph: "Your second paragraph here"
    - paragraph: "Etc..."
```

**`gallery.yaml`**

Use this file to reference the images in `photos/gallery/`. You can do this manually or automatically by running `python3 gallery.py`. You can also assign tags to the photos here.

```yaml
images:
- src: gallery/your_photo_1.jpg
  tags: ["portrait"]
- src: gallery/your_photo_2.jpg
  tags: ["portrait", "sunset", "boat"]
- src: gallery/your_photo_3.jpg
  tags: ["landscape", "sea", "beach", "sand"]
```

**`themes/`**

```sh
themes/
â””â”€â”€ yourtheme/
    â”œâ”€â”€ fonts (optional)
    â”œâ”€â”€ theme.yaml
    â”œâ”€â”€ theme.css (optional)
    â””â”€â”€ favicon.png
```

**Lumeex** is shipped with two prebuilt themes:
  - Modern ðŸ‘‰ [demo](https://modern.djeex.fr)
  - Typewriter ðŸ‘‰ [demo](https://typewriter.djeex.fr)

You can edit existing themes or create your own. Each theme can include:
- **Required:** a `theme.yaml` file for visual settings (colors, fonts, etc.)
- *(Optional)* a `theme.css` file for additional styling
- *(Optional)* a `fonts` folder for local fonts
- *(Optional)* a square `favicon.png` (min 196px) that will be automatically converted to all required formats.

Example `theme.yaml`:

```yaml
colors:
  primary: '#0065a1'
  primary_dark: '#005384'
  secondary: '#00b0f0'
  accent: '#ffc700'
  text_dark: '#333'
  background: '#fff'
  browser_color: '#fff'
favicon:
  path: favicon.png
google_fonts:
  - family: Lato 
    weights:
    - '200'
    - '400'
    - '700'
  - family: Montserrat
    weights:
    - '200'
    - '400'
    - '700'
fonts:
  primary:
    name: Lato
    fallback: sans-serif
  secondary:
    name: Montserrat
    fallback: serif
```

## Build the Site

Once everything is configured, make sure you're in the `lumeex` directory and your Python virtual environment is activated (`source .venv/bin/activate`).

- *(Optional)* Run `python3 gallery.py` to auto-fill `gallery.yaml` and add carousel photos to `site.yaml`. Don't forget to add tags to your photos in `gallery.yaml`.
- Run `python3 build.py` to generate the static site.
- *(Optional)* Serve locally with:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 3000 --directory .output
```

Then visit `http://localhost:3000` or, if remote, `http://your-server-ip:3000`. 

> [!WARNING]
> Use this only to test your site. Don't use python server for production !

- Finally, copy the contents of the `.output/` directory to your favorite web server.
