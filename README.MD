**Lumeex** - Yet another minimalist very light photo gallery with a static site generator.

Lumeex is a static site generator that builds a minimalist photo gallery. The project was born from the need to create a gallery focused more on the artworks than the author, while allowing users to organize works using tags and share filtered views. In this spirit, each page load displays the photos in random order, allowing users to discover new content they might not have seen before.

The project comes with two themes: one modern, the other more minimalistic, both designed to keep the focus on the artworks:
  - Modern ðŸ‘‰ [check the demo](https://modern.djeex.fr)
  - Typewriter ðŸ‘‰ [check the demo](https://typewriter.djeex.fr)
